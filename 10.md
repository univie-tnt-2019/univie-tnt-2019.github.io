# Goals:

To learn how to map quantifiable data, for example, mentions of different geographical locations in a given text. The first step will involve: learning about techniques for 1) extracting geographical data from texts; and about 2) preparing necessary data for mapping.

## Examples of the final work:

* <https://maximromanov.github.io/2014/08-23.html> ([VIDEO](https://vimeo.com/121887453))

## Data needed

* Placename - to add a label to a map
* Lat,Lon - to place a dot on a map
* Frequency - to size a dot on a map
* TimeParameter - if we want to visualize change over time

# Software & Technologies:

* `python` (matching, reformatting, calculating frequencies)

# Class:

Basic techniqies with for extracting geographical data usually include:

1. **HARD**: NER (named-entity recognition): matching against a gazetteer (a dictionary of geographical names, or toponyms) to identify potential toponyms in a text; additional NLP (natural language processing) may be used to disambiguate matches. 
2. **EASY**-*ish*: Extracting toponyms from pre-tagged texts (*our case*)

## Step 1. Extracting relevant data

### Example:

``` xml

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57" />It is my firm opinion,
substantiated by that of my family physician's, that
<persName n="Baker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014"
reg="nearbymention:Baker,E.,E.,," authname="baker,e.,e.">
<surname full="yes">Baker</surname></persName>'s Premium
Bitters is the best medicine now before the public for the
above mentioned diseases. </p> <closer> <salute>Yours,
most truly,</salute> <signed><persName n="Quarles,,P.,W.,J.,"
id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Quarles,P.,W.,J.,"
authname="quarles,p.,w.,j."><foreName full="yes">P.</foreName>
<foreName full="yes">W.</foreName>  <foreName full="yes">J.</foreName>
<surname full="yes">Quarles</surname></persName>.</signed>
<lb /> These Bitters can be had of all the <name>Druggists</name>

reg="default:Baker,E.,,," authname="baker,e."><foreName full="yes">

Proprietor, <lb /> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia"
key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>
<lb /> oc <num value="30">30</num>--ts </closer> </div4>
</div3> 

<div3 type="advert" n="4" org="uniform" sample="complete">

<year reg="1860" full="yes">1860</year></dateStruct>.
<lb />Great Rush for Bargains.<lb />Tremendous Excitement.</head> 

```

### Toward a Solution...

* Our general script can be modified accordingly: instead of removing XML tags, we can extract relevant information and create another CSV file, of the following format: `Placename, Frequency`
* Toponyms are described as `<placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964" authname="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>`
    - Not all `<placeName ....>` are the placenames that we need
    - We can use strings like `authname="tgn,7013964"` or `key="tgn,7013964"` to check if a result is a toponym; **NB:** try to figure out what `tgn` is and whether this can be helpful in any way.
    - What should go into `Placename`?

* Frequencies can be calculated with a `dictionary`, where keys are `Placename` and values are `Frequency`.

``` python
dicFreq = {}

for i in listOfResults:
    # some additional code may be required here
    #   you might also want to filter out items of certain type:
    #   for example, exclude advertisement (which is likely to be local only)
    if i in dicFreq:
        dicFreq[i] += 1
    else:
        dicFreq[i]  = 1

```

* Dictionary of frequencies can be then reformatted into a frequency list, which can be sorted by frequencies; one of the common techniques is usually to exclude low frequency values (for example those with frequencies 1; alternatively, relevant threshhold can be determined through a descriptive statistics method). 

``` python

resultsCSV = []

for key, value in dicFreq.items():
    if value > 1: # this will exclude items with frequency 1
        newVal = "%09d\t%s" % (value, key)
        # newVal will looks like: `000005486 TAB Richmond`
        resultsCSV.append(newVal)

resultsCSV = sorted(resultsCSV, reverse=True)
print(len(resultsCSV)) # will print out the number of items in the list
resultsToSave = "\n".join(resultsCSV)

```

* **Additional**: Try to include all items and check how the results will differ (in terms of the number of toponyms/placenames). You can use `print(len(resultsCSV))` to get a quick count of results in the `resultsCSV` list.

**NB:** for the final map we will need also *time parameters*, so that we could visualize our data chronologically.

### Problem

Although we can collect data, it is not yet mappable. We need to create relevant data that would allow us to place our frequency information on a map. We need coordinates!

## Step 2. Data (coordinates)

* Download `US.zip` from *Geonames.org* (<http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/>).
* Important description of the data can be found here: <http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt>

The next step is to find all relevant coordinates. We can write a script that will match our data vs. the data from *Geonames.org*. This can be done as follows: 

* create a `python dictionary (I)` from our frequency data, where `keys` are placenames, and `values`—the entire `TSV` record.
* create another `python dictionary (II)` from *Geonames* data, where `keys` are also placenames and `values`—the entire `TSV` record; there are likely to be multiple records with the same placenames—how would you deal with those? (*Hint*: you do not want to overwrite one with another; in order to avoid that, you can save `values` as `lists`, and append new records if there are more than one).
* **NB:** you will need to consult <http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt> in order to figure out what is what in that data file.
* now, you can loop through `python dictionary (I)` and check if a `key (I)` exists in `python dictionary (II)`; if yes, than you can add records to a new variable where you would collect only relevant toponyms; you can then save these selected records and manually re-check them.

### Alternative ways of collecting coordinates

* If you have a map of relevant area, you can georeference it and harvest coordinates from your georeferenced map; you can then also visualize your data on that very map, which might be a very nice touch visually.
* As a last resort, you can always manually collect required coordinates, which, however, is the most time-consuming of doing this.

# Homework (1/2 and 2/2):

1. GISting the “Dispatch” II: Mapping geographical data from the “Dispatch”
    * Extract toponyms (place names) from the “Dispatch” (python)
    * Calculate their frequencies (python)
    * Add coordinates to those places (QGIS/python)
        * *Hint*: you can create two lists 1) one with place names and their frequencies, 2) with place names and their coordinates; after that, you can merge them with python and generate a CSV file (placename, timeParameter, latitude, longitude, frequency) which can be used for creating a map in QGIS 
    * Map them in QGIS, using frequencies to size the markers on the map
