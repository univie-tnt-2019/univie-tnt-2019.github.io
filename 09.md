title: Structuring Data
subtitle: Major Formats
---

# Goals:

To learn about the major data formats and practice writing scripts that generate (or reformat) data into a specific format.

# Software & Technologies:

* `python` (simple scripting, regular expressions, batch processing)
* basic data formats: *csv/tsv* (comma/tab-separated values), *json*, *yml*, etc.  

# Class:

* explanation of major formats and their importance
* hands-on: converting data into structured formats

## The Essence

The ease of editing, suitability for analytical software, human-friendliness and  readability, open vs. proprietary.

### XML

``` xml
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>
```

### CSV/TSV

```
to,from,heading,body
Tove,Jani,Reminder,Don't forget me this weekend!
```

### JSON

``` json
{
  "to": "Tove",
  "from": "Jani",
  "heading": "Reminder",
  "body": "Don't forget me this weekend!"
}
```

### YML

```
to: Tove
from: Jani
heading: Reminder
body: Don't forget me this weekend
```


# Larger Examples


**NB** data example from [here](https://gist.github.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29).

There are some online converters that can help you to convert one format into another. For example: <http://www.convertcsv.com/>.

### `CSV` / `TSV`

```
city,growth_from_2000_to_2013,latitude,longitude,population,rank,state
New York,4.8%,40.7127837,-74.0059413,8405837,1,New York
Los Angeles,4.8%,34.0522342,-118.2436849,3884307,2,California
Chicago,-6.1%,41.8781136,-87.6297982,2718782,3,Illinois
Houston,11.0%,29.7604267,-95.3698028,2195914,4,Texas
Philadelphia,2.6%,39.9525839,-75.1652215,1553165,5,Pennsylvania
```

`TSV` is a better option than a `CSV`, since `TAB` characters are very unlikely to appear in values.

Neither `TSV` not `CSV` are good for preserving *new line characters* (`\n`)—or, in other words, text split into multiple lines. As a workaround, one can convert `\n` into some unlikely-to-occur character combination (for example, `;;;`), which would allow to restore `\n` later , if necessary.

### `JSON`

``` json
[
    {
        "city": "New York", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "4.8%", 
        "latitude": 40.7127837, 
        "longitude": -74.0059413, 
        "population": "8405837", 
        "rank": "1", 
        "state": "New York"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Los Angeles", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "4.8%", 
        "latitude": 34.0522342, 
        "longitude": -118.2436849, 
        "population": "3884307", 
        "rank": "2", 
        "state": "California"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Chicago", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "-6.1%", 
        "latitude": 41.8781136, 
        "longitude": -87.6297982, 
        "population": "2718782", 
        "rank": "3", 
        "state": "Illinois"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Houston", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "11.0%", 
        "latitude": 29.7604267, 
        "longitude": -95.3698028, 
        "population": "2195914", 
        "rank": "4", 
        "state": "Texas"
    }, 
    {
        "city": "Philadelphia", 
        "growth_from_2000_to_2013": "2.6%", 
        "latitude": 39.9525839, 
        "longitude": -75.1652215, 
        "population": "1553165", 
        "rank": "5", 
        "state": "Pennsylvania"
    }
]
```


### `YML` (*not a serial format*)

``` yaml

city: New York 
growth_from_2000_to_2013: 4.8% 
latitude: 40.7127837 
longitude: -74.0059413
population: 8405837 
rank: 1 
state: New York

```


### Misc: YAML-like custom format

```

# Homework:

1. reformatting the “Dispatch”: generate one TSV-file with the entire content of the “Dispatch”, where each article (or, more broadly—an entry) is a single record; each record should include:
    1. date;
    2. type of an entry (there are articles, advertisements, notices, etc);
    3. header;
    4. the text of an entry.
2. publish the description of this process (with excerpts of code) on your website.
3. Codecademy’s *Learn Python*, Unit 11-12.
4. Github: publish the confirmation screenshot as a post on your new site.
